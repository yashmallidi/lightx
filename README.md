# LightX

LightX is a physics engine that aims to provide realistic and accurate physics simulation for games, while also being fast and efficient.

## Todos 📝

* *Rigid body dynamics*
* *Collision detection and response*
* *Constraints and joints*
* *Soft body dynamics*
* *Cloth simulation*
* *Fluid simulation*
* *Uses SIMD instructions and multithreading*

## Motivation 💡

I am making this engine to learn more about physics and game development. I want to create a physics engine that can handle complex and realistic physics scenarios without compromising the performance or the quality of the gameplay.

## Note 📌

* *LightX is still under development and not yet ready for production use. Development may take a while, so please be patient and check back later for updates and release*
